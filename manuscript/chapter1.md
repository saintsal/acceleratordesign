# The Accelerator Design Guide

This guide covers a set of guiding principles, specific design tools and techniques - and a set of questions to help frame your design decisions.

I've been intrinsically involved in over 20 accelerators and 4 university entrepreneurship programmes, designing and delivering the bulk of their education.  I've build Founder Centric and recently Source Institute to do this on a larger scale.

Over the years, clients have asked us to design their programmes. We contintue to work closely with Seedcamp, UCL, Oxford University, Microsoft Ventures, The Royal Academy Of Engineering, to name a few.

We've seen accelerators move startups faster and help founders achieve their goals countless times. And we've been a driving force in evolving the accelerator model.

## How to create an accelerator that fits

As the accelerator industry blossoms, the accelerator model is being applied in far more diverse contexts, like creative businesses, industry verticals, corporate R&D, and niche markets. 

For most first-time accelerators, there's a bias towards copying the existing 3-month model.  But most don't know the reasons it exists. We'll start with this, explaining the history of accelerators and helping you filter out which aspects are relevant in your context.

The standard accelerator model (and definition) doesn't always apply - programmes must be redesigned, and lessons learned are valuable to share between all the variations that are emerging.

We'll also share lessons from our own accelerator projects in farther reaching contexts, like accelerators for freelancers, developing economies, and corporates with strategic goals that don't involve startup equity.

## The history of accelerators
Y Combinator is widely cited as the first accelerator.  It was started in 2005 in Boston by Paul Graham, a British entrepreneur and investor, who had founded an ecommerce company which he sold to Yahoo for $49M. 

The initial programme was a combination of hands-on investing and incubator. Paul would invest in student startup ideas - giving them the resources and support they needed over their summer holidays.  The length of the programme? Three months - over the summer break.  The investment amount?  Slightly more than a student could make in a summer job.

This marked a new model in business incubation: the accelerator.  The key difference was that the business support was organised around cohorts of businesses at a similar stage with a similar goal - in this case, onward seed investment.  There was a predefined expiry date on the support, but those that were successful had a clear path to another stage of support.

Y Combinator moved to Silicon Valley in 2009, and expanded its intake (called a pipeline in the industry) to include more than students.  It mainained it's basic structure, in which its partners have weekly contact with each startup, and the startups are largely expected to work independently and pull in Y Combinator's resources as needed.

As it's evolved, it's changed it's funding policies, and launched a number of programmes that defend it's reputation lead, such as it's forum called Hacker News, it's online startup school, an earlier-stage investment programme offering a few thousand dollars and remote support, and recently a foundation to experiment on new ways to deliver startup support.

Y Combinator has invested around a thousand companies including Dropbox, Airbnb, Coinbase, Stripe, Reddit, Zenefits, Instacart and Weebly.  It is, by almost all measures, hundreds of times more successful than any other accelerator.

Techstars was a fast-follower, and soon moved to franchise it's model.  Techstars copied the basic Y Combinator programme, and replaced experienced venture partners with a large group of advisors - called mentors - to support startups.  It is associated with the Global Accelerator Network, which helped diffuse this model.

It's worth noting, as a veteran in the industry, that there are significant differences between the Y Combinator and Techstars models.  Many programmes choose the Techstars model while seeking Y Combinator results, unaware of the distinction.

## The definition of accelerator
The definition of accelerator has shifted over time, including increasingly diverse programmes. A few core elements:

- They support early stage companies

- They group startups by their next major goal and structure group support accordingly. 

- They have a clear end date for support.

## Misconceptions about accelerators
There a quite few major misconceptions about the definition of an accelerator.  Understanding them will help us design better programmes. 

### An accelerator must operate with cohorts.  
Seedcamp and HackFWD are two very successful cases that chose to select only the best startups they could find. They rejected the strict cohort model, since it would force them to select among what was available in a given time window.

### Everyone must share the same office space. 
Y Combinator and Seedcamp don't insist that startups work from their space. The support they offer is designed to give startups independence and pull resources as needed.

### The programme must be a seed investor.  
Microsoft operates one of the world's most successful accelerator networks - and they don't take equity. This allows them to work with startups who are not only there because of their strategic fit to Microsoft, but they also attract a higher calibre of startup who reject the low valuations placed on them by standard accelerators.

### Support necessarily ends at the end of the programme.  
While setting a clear end date in advance creates a healthy relationship with startups, the reality is that the successful startups receive support after the programme. Plus, the best accelerators have strong alumni groups. 

### Accelerators only support startup teams with 2 or 3 co-founders. 
EntrepreneurFirst, whose portfolio companies are valued at $150 million, invests in individuals even before they have an idea or a team.

### Total investment raised indicated success.
Total investment raised is usually a number cited by franchise accelerator networks - it seems impressive, but is misleading.  Looking for *average* investment raised, or percentage of startups that reach profitablity or exit usually tells a much starker story. 

### The main goal of an accelerator is to help startups raise money from investors. 
The most successful accelerators add value beyond pitch practice and an investor network. In fact, some accelerators like Camden's Creative Accelerator help creative people launch SMEs.  



## Behind the scenes
It's one thing to design business models on paper, and quite another to design them in practice.  Let's dig in behind the scenes a bit, and look at what some of the unspoken truths:

### Accelerators mean long hours
No matter how much you plan in advance, or how large your team, you're going to face long hours.  On top of scheduling everything, taking care of the legals, and getting your teams settled in, almost everything will be a moving target.  Each startup will be 

### Selection is a black art
In spite of investment theses and modeling and research, selection usually comes down to artitrary and committee decisions. After hearing pitches, you'll have a long meeting, making in or out calls, often on gut feeling.  These decisions force you to predict the future on very little information. They're the most crucial decisions you'll make in the entire programme, and they're irreversible.

### The winners become visible soon
Within the first month of the programme, you'll see which teams were good investments - not always from progress, but from seeing how they work together and how they execute.  At this point, different partners will start to favour certain teams, and by the end of the programme, you'll generally have written off a few teams informally to focus on leaders in the race.

### The Pipeline problem
The startup and accelerator bubble have created a pipeline problem.  There are more and more accelerators on the market, attracting more and more people to create startups. Overall, this is a great thing!  But for your accelerator, you'll be competing among other accelerators for novice startup founders who mostly see accelerators as a commodity service, or worse, a necessary evil to get funded.  In the past, acceleraters all had thousands of applications, so it was possible to select 10 solid, investable teams from the pipeline.  Now, it's common to have several hundred applications.  Pickings are slim.

### Reputation
The exception to this rule are the accelerators that have built a solid reputation among their alumni.  The most savvy entrepreneurs, the ones you want, work through reputation and introduction. They learn from existing alumni, not from the brand accelerator's portray.  Founders have come to distrust websites citing a long list of mentors - who they know probably won't show up - or industry accolades.  These techniques only attract the least investible - reputation is what counts.

### Roadshows & fishing
In these conditions, opening your doors won't lead to a flood of applications. In many ways, the cohort model has become outdated, but it still serves to create a little bit of buzz so founders know you exist. But to get decent applications, accelerators need to go fishing.  This involves touring pitch events and conferences, as well as partners living on planes for weeks and months as they scour the region to find and lure in the best startups they can find.

### Hacking
Investors and founders alike are excited by big success stories, and it's become common to "hack in" winning teams.  This is when you accidentally reject a team at selection, or fail to attract a great team to apply.  In these cases, the startup usually negotiates a more favourable deal than your standard offer, and enters the programme late.  This allows accelerators to show their success overall, but the hacking is usually kept quite since that success wouldn't be attributed to the support itself.


# Acceleration Goals 
Now that we have a clear picture of the situation, we can see why custom designing a programme around our goals will have a tremendous effect on our efficiency.

So let's start with our goals, our startups goals, and work our way backwards to find where we can be most effective.

*What specific goals do have in common with your founders?*

From the founders perspective, what goal or milestone can we make happen sooner? The standard accelerator model takes the onward funding round as that goal - bringing it to 3-months instead of 12+-months.

For your startups, the goal doesn't have to be a funding round, but it should be a founder goal that is clearly defined such as an early client, a loan, or a validated business model. It doesn't even need to be objective or measurable, as long as you can somehow evaluate it. A clear definition of this goal will help make other design decisions, and will be the bedrock for improvement with every cohort.   

## What Does Accelerated Mean For Your Teams? 

From the founders perspective, what goal or milestone can we make happen sooner? The standard accelerator model takes the onward funding round as that goal - bringing it to 3-months instead of 12+-months.

For your startups, the goal doesn't have to be a funding round, but it should be a founder goal that is clearly defined such as an early client, a loan, or a validated business model. It doesn't even need to be objective or measurable, as long as you can somehow evaluate it. A clear definition of this goal will help make other design decisions, and will be the bedrock for improvement with every cohort.

## Lower Lead Time 

Before the program, consider the aspects of getting to market where teams will struggle with long lead-times - those are critical time-wasters for teams, and can be eliminated quite easily by readying the accelerator network.

Often, this is in making connections, both customer and industry, but frequently enough, its some form of education or attitude-adjustment which needs time to set in before they can take full advantage of what you have to offer.

It's your job, as an accelerator, to shorten these lead times to days and hours. This means a lot of time over-invested in getting resources, connections and knowledge at the ready.

A key point to remember here is that optimising the programme around reducing lead time for teams can necessitate wasted effort for the accelerator. Getting 5 leads ready when the startup only acts on 2 is better than only one lead or 2 leads, a week later, because the startup progresses at an accelerated rate. The time investment for the acclerator pays off.

When the program starts, it's prudent to reevaluate these needs with your teams, letting them lead the discussion. A Post Up is useful way to do this.

## What Wheel-spinning Can You Reduce? 

With their noses to the grindstone, it's often tough for teams to look up and realise all their hard work hasn't moved them forward. With the tight time constraiints of an accelerator, if even a week are two are wasted in this way, that means a large enough gap in momentum that they're unlikely to have the exit velocity required to succeed in the accelerator.

The hard part is maintaining frequent, open and structured-enough contact with teams so that you can catch this.

Building in peer support mechanisms can help here (more on this below) as can a foosball table to have informal chats with your founders.

We've found that a special type of regular meeting can help too, where we simply ask them how it's going on their own terms (not the terms we'd like to impose) and ask where we can help and what's taking longer than expected. With 20 minutes once per week, we can get a sense if they're struggling in a number of specific areas - customer empathy, metrics, product, go-to-market, introductions, iteration speed - and flag up specific actions or help we can bring in to unblock them. We can also compare our notes week-on-week, using a simple paper tool we've designed called The Cohort Report.

## What Defines Progress? What Attitude And Culture Do You Want Around This? 

hese. If they're reporting on up-and-to-the-right metrics, these will turn into corporate presentations, where the teams feel they are "reporting to their boss," only sharing the good news, and leaving out more ambitious goals to show they're acheiving their targets.

If you're looking for founders to make frequent course-corrections, for example, it makes sense to ask them to report on learning goals. A metrics focus tends to lead to optimisation activities, whereas learning goals keep the focus on fundamentals.

So it's worth considering what truly defines progress - is it traction? learning? growth? - so your questioning and reporting mechanisms instil the desired culture.

You'll notice the culture will form fairly quickly as the cohort coalesces. There are some ways to influence this:

1. To some degree, this will be driven by a few alpha founders. Be wary of strong personalities that oppose your ideals during selection - they can counter-act your desired attitudes across the cohort.

2. Plant seeds in terms of story-telling and hero worship. Ask in founders for dinner to share their war stories. Ask them to be inclusive - welcoming the cohort to their club. Read biographies of founders you'd like to see emulated - and tell "did you know?" stories. Print posters with startup advice, or even imgur memes if appropriate. Get strong quotes printed as vinyl decals for you wall - like in museums.

3. Be sensitive to your own behaviour, especially in the first few weeks of the programme. It's worth being clear and direct in terms of expectations from the outset. My typical advice is, "You're all expected to multiply your valuation by 5 or more in the next 90 days. This means you'll have to aim for big leaps and learnng every week - if you're stuck on something for 2 weeks, you're probably a goner. You'll have to get rid of lead times, like waiting for customers or advisors to reply - put the programme to work by asking for the connections you'll need. And you'll be expected to support each other, spot when another startup is stuck and dislodge them." If you catch yourself reprimanding or commanding teams, you'll risk ending up with a primary-school dynamic with your teams, rather than a one that emphasises taking responsibility and being open.
    

# Design For Responsiveness 

Your teams are all capable, and all on different paths. Rather than try to predict their needs, we want to be responsive. We want to be helpful when they need us. We want to get out of the way when they need to execute.

We recommend an enabling, responsive approach, rather than trying to predict their needs or impose a procedure.

It's easy to imagine how teams will progress through each week of your accelerator, learning from customers, mentors, investors, building a product, then learning to pitch; and we can even envisage how we can move from one topic to the next, week by week. All very orderly.

In reality, every team will choose its own path, and attempts to predict their needs beyond the first few weeks cause frustration. If you've run an accelerator before, you've experienced how founders retaliate against scheduled activities they don't find helpful. They just want to get on with their company.

Often, it makes sense to schedule placeholders for workshops and mentors, so founders can schedule their lives around those times without conflict, and you can fill them with relevant help as needs arise.

## Herding Cats

It's tough to design a programme to accelerate entrepreneurs; their paths aren't set, their preferences are unknown and their needs aren't predictable.

We often overlook the communication and scheduling overhead that's required to keep a good programme running. It's a people business, first and foremost, and for every founder, there's a multiple of mentors, supporters, investors and events that all need to take place in compressed time frame.

If you've done this before, you know it's like herding cats; a lot of individual effort, a lot of exceptions - and a lot of late nights.

I always explain this reality to new programme directors; it's going to be just as gruelling for you as for your founders.

The important thing to do now is to accept this nature of the business, and design for it, rather than pretend it isn't the case.

## Don't Mix Up Scheduling With Predicting

Accelerators tend to waste time dealing with schedule conflicts, push-backs from frustrated founders, and chasing founders.

This friction often comes from a disconnect between the accelerator's pre-conceived expectation of founder needs, and the immediate needs themselves.

Beyond the first few weeks, we recommend scheduling place-holder workshops where the content is not yet defined.

An easy compromise is to schedule placeholders - where the time and place is set in advance, but the content can be changed closer to the day. This makes sure workshops are as relevant as possible at the time, but still allows teams to schedule their activities, like travel and meetings.

On a similar note, scheduling accelerator activities on specific days of the week to allow for weekly business trips if necessary.

## Give Them Time To Apply What They've Learned  

Many programmes are keen to load up founders with as much education as possible - often all up-front.

We've found that knowledge retention and application suffer in these cases, because teams don't have time to apply what they've learned.

Don't overload teams with education at the outset. An initial toolset can be helpful, but for teaching to take hold and demonstrate a return on your investment, it needs to be applied and ideally assimilated into your teams modus operandi. This takes time, so consider spacing out education.

##  Seek Attitude Shift Over Methodology Adoption 

When we started Founder-Centric, we thought we were hired to teach founders about Business Model Generation and Lean Startup. What we learned is that our true value comes from attitude shift, where founders understand and apply the principles, rather than go through the motions with the tools.

In the early part of the program, help founders build their toolset, but beware that insisting on any specific tools or methodologies can have unintended consequences on their team dynamic and relationship with you. Methodologies often take time to get right - time the team doesn't have to spare. Principles, on the other hand, are easily grasped and rallied-around.

Just like there's a difference between learning to be a hacker, and learning how to program, there's a difference between learning to be founder and learning how to "do Lean Startup." Both can be taught, but one is more effective.

##  Design For The Information You Need To Respond. 

We need information to respond to our founders' needs, whether implicit or explicit. Ingraining the use of tools and formats that allow us insight into their thinking and decisions can give us this visibility regularly.

# Design Around The Founders' Jobs-to-be-done 

Strip away the unnecessary.

Whatever the goal of your accelerator - whether it's the startup's next investment round, a pilot project rolled out, or getting to profitability - we need to design a programme that cuts out the extraneous to get them there faster.

There's very little margin for error. A few hours per week wasted, or a week or two mired in hessitation or conflict, and we've failed that startup.

Having a few clear acceleration goals serves three purposes:

1. They help attract quality applicants in your pipeline.

2.  They align your startups' motivations with your own.
    
3. They serve as a guide for programme design decisions.

Contrarily, having too many goals, or adding elements to your programme that are incongruent with everyone's goals (often just because you've seen them in another accelerator) leads to tension.

This tension slows things down, and this slow-down makes good startups fail in accelerators.

Often, this is perceived as a selection problem; bad apples, lacking ambition, or just "not getting it". But in cases where those same founders succeed outside of the accelerator, it often comes down to an alignment issue with their host accelerator.

If you're familiar with Customer Development, this is a familiar principle. When you discover a customer's job-to-be-done, this had a direct effect on your market positioning, as well as your product. You speak to the customers' job-to-be-done, and you only include features that help them.

Let's look at few examples.

## Demo Day 

Demo Days involve a significant trade-off to consider.

They move focus away from the startups actual businesses, as the programme directors turn their attention to investor relations, and the startups are forced to work on pitching, rather than their business.

If well-marketed and well-attended by active and relevant investors, they can be a create a step-change in both the accelerator's and the startups' reputations, and open the door to customer and investor relationships.

Don't underestimate the size of that if though.

Ignite100, in the UK, dropped it's demo day. This was a bold move, but understandable to many UK accelerators.

> The issue is context; a demo day achieves little beyond proving a founder can deliver a slick slide-deck based on a tried-and-tested, and quite tired formula.

> There are fundamental issues from a team's point of view. One founder must write scripts, design slides, be coached within an inch of their lives, practice once or more a day, every day for weeks. At the same time, programme managers demand teams double-down on their efforts to build a business. For a team of just two or three founders, being expected to be investment ready whilst simultaneously preparing for demo day effectively ties a hand behind their backs.

- Paul Smith, Ignite100's programme director

Replacing Demo Day with a more continuous approach to investor/startup match-making relieves the strain:

> We wanted to ensure that every team joining Ignite would be backed by successful angels who cared about supporting new talent and technology.

> We were inspired by one of our investors, who last year performed his own experiment; feeling the London tech investment scene was more fragmented than most considered it to be, Doug Scott arranged (and attended) a series of 13 lunches over consecutive days, each attended by over 20 VCs, angel investors and other guests from his address book. The result? Every day, a roomful of people made new contacts, discussed portfolios and opportunities and expanded their own personal and professional networks.

> So instead of herding 150 people into a dark room, we're going to try a similar experiment; we'll hold a series of lunches in London, perhaps over two or three days - for founders, investors, press and invited guests. Teams will still need to convey their stories, they'll still need to demonstrate their prototypes, but these events will provide the opportunity for relationships to be further explored and strengthened in a more intimate, informal setting. There'll be a finite amount of invites available - no more spray and pray - and instead of robbing investors of up to half of their workday, a lunch better-fits with their daily routine.

## Round-robin Mentoring 

Emerge Venture Lab replaced the common round-robin mentor days with a new version: fewer, but longer sessions with mentors that were selected by the startups themselves. They also developed a mentor training programme (with us) so they could make better use of domain experts without startup experience.

It's worth noting that Y Combinator didn't include mentor days, and instead, simply had partners make intros to relevant helpers during office hours.


### Consider

Mentor-startup matching isn't hard, but scheduling mentors often is.

If your job is to get the best mentors for each of your startups, how can you make your life easier?


## Equity 

When truly assessing the success factors for funders, many accelerators have chosen not to take equity. This improves the quality of applicants, and allows the programme to focus on what matters to everyone. In the case of Microsoft, the benefits come from participating with the startups; key employees learning by helping, visibility of coming trends, helping their corporate customers be more innovative through startup intros, and helping more startups use their products. These benefits are multiplied substantially by the increased competition to enter the accelerator since it doesn't cost equity.

# Peer-support 

We like to setup a peer-support culture, focused on learning progress, so the teams hold themselves accountable.

We remain closely involved, both casually and through group Braintrust meetings and 1-on-1 check-ins, which are designed to spot wheel-spinning and opportunities for the accelerator to shorten lead-times. (We've found this is at the heart of acceleration.)

These flag up problems that are easily resolved via intros, resource, or help from you. In some cases, yoou can help un-block your teams by pulling in a relevent workshop or expert.

## How can you get teams to support themselves?

When a team spends more than a week stuck on the same problem, that's a warning sign. If they spend two weeks, it's critical. Three weeks, and the vultures are circling - it's unlikely they'll achieve the acceleration goal.

As much as we'd like to think stand-ups, weekly meetings or playing table football will help us spot these problems, it's the founders peers who naturally have this insight. No matter how cool you are, you'll always be bad cop to their good cop.

Installing a culture and structure of peer-support that focuses on avoiding wheel-spinning can help. How can you do that? (If you'd like, check out Braintrust, a peer-support format we've developed over the last 3 years.)  
  

# Approaches To Design 
## Just Do It, then Iterate

Whether starting an accelerator for a region, or a particular vertical, or a type of founder, these accelerator directors simply hit the ground running, with a view that the important changes will come from experience after the first cohort.

They generally stick to the standard 3 months, with round-robin mentoring, and a demo day at the end.

What they discover, other than general structural improvements to the program, are who and how they can help best. So next time, they have a more specific sense of who qualifies and why, adapting their model around their investment thesis. I've seen programs shift selection and support towards a B2B, sports-only, emerging trends like Internet Of Things, or particular tech stacks, but only after it was clear this made sense from actual startup progress.

This is learning that can only be acted on at the end of cohort #1, so the directors know getting their ASAP is a worthy goal. They say hindsight is 20/20, so better get some hindsight!

## Challenge The Model

A lot of program directors challenge the standard 3-month + demo model from the outset. Paul Orlando at AccelerateHK originally tried a range of program lengths, iCatapult in Budapest added 9-months of post-demo day support, Searchcamp focuses on educating founders, Collective Accelerator gives access to free debt rather than taking equity.

Many programmes have challenged onward funding as the main goal, focusing on a rapid field trial or enterprise client #1 instead. This is particularly happening in industry-specific accelerators - engineering, medical, cleantech, finance, education.

Others have moved away from equity-based funding models altogether, benefitting instead from knowledge-exchange, PR, and partnerships. 

# Get Help

Source Institute is rooted in the startup community, and we've chosen a business model that allows us to stay true to that. We only charge for delivering workshops, and keep our content open so you and others can deliver it too.

This means we can always spend some time to help you with program design, and we're happy to put you in touch with other accelerator directors.

If you have the chance, join us for a retreat, where accelerators, universities and business support people come together to trade notes themselves.
